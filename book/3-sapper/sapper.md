# Sapper - Making Svelte Real

TODO: Sprinkle in building a Sapper app into each of these sections.

This article provides a thorough introduction to Sapper
and walks through the fundamentals necessary
to start building web applications with it.

## What Is Sapper

Sapper (<https://sapper.svelte.dev/>) is a framework built on
Svelte (<https://svelte.dev/>) for creating web applications.

Svelte is an alternative to web frameworks like React, Vue, and Angular.
For more detail, see
<https://objectcomputing.com/resources/publications/sett/july-2019-web-dev-simplified-with-svelte>.

Sapper provides many features that are not part of Svelte.
These include:

- page routing
- page layouts
- server-side rendering (SSR)
- Node-based REST services (server routes)
- pre-fetching for faster page loads
- code splitting
- static site generation (exporting)
- offline support using ServiceWorker
- end-to-end testing

The name "Sapper" has two meanings.
First, it is a contraction of "Svelte app maker".
Second, the English word "sapper" is defined as
"a soldier responsible for tasks such as building and repairing
roads and bridges, laying and clearing mines, etc."
In a sense, this is what Sapper does for Svelte.

Sapper was created and is maintained by Rich Harris (Rich-Harris),
the creator of Svelte, with help from many others including
Alan Faubert (Conduitry), Luke Edwards (lukeed),
Maur√≠cio Kishi (mrkishi), and Nolan Lawson (nolanlawson).

## Getting Started

Let's walk through the steps to create and run a Sapper application.

1. Install Node.js from <https://nodejs.org>.

   This installs the `node`, `npm`, and `npx` commands.

2. Create the starting directory structure and files for a new application.  
   Choose between using the Rollup or Webpack module bundler.  
   To use Rollup, enter `npx degit "sveltejs/sapper-template#rollup"` _`app-name`_.  
   To use Webpack, enter `npx degit "sveltejs/sapper-template#webpack"` _`app-name`_.

   The `degit` tool is useful for project scaffolding.
   It was created by Rich Harris.
   It downloads a git repo, by default the master branch.
   In this case "sveltejs" is the user name and "sapper-template" is the repo.
   The second argument is the name of the application
   and the name of the sub-directory to create.

3. `cd` _`app-name`_

4. `npm install`

5. `npm run dev`

   This starts a local HTTP server and provides live reload,
   unlike `npm run start` which omits live reload.

6. Browse localhost:3000

   The default Sapper app contains three pages or routes
   with navigation at the top.
   The routes are "home", "about", and "blog".
   Links on the "blog" page open sub-pages
   that render specific blog content.
   These pages are shown below:

   ![home page](./sapper-home.png)

   ![about page](./sapper-about.png)

   ![blog page](./sapper-blog.png)

   The following page is rendered when the first link on the previous page is clicked.

   ![sapper page](./sapper-blog-sub.png)

You are now ready to start modifying the app.

## Sapper File Structure

Sapper apps created from the `sveltejs/sapper-template`
begin with the following directory structure:

- `__sapper__`

  - `build`: destination for build artifacts

  - `dev`: destination for development-mode artifacts

- `cypress`: contains directories and files for running end-to-end tests

- `node_modules`: contains files for `package.json` dependencies

- `src`: contains application code

  - `components`: contains Svelte components used in pages

    - `Nav.svelte`: defines the nav bar links
      - Modify this to change page navigation.

  - `routes`: contains Svelte components that represent pages

  - `client.js`: starting point of the client-side Sapper app

  - `server.js`: configures the server used for server routes

    - This uses Polka by default.
    - It can be modified to use another library such as Express.

  - `service-worker.js`: defines the ServiceWorker caching strategy

  - `template.html`: HTML template for the Sapper app
    - This defines the `sapper` DOM id targeted by `client.js`.

- `static`: contains static assets such as images and the `global.css` file

- `cypress.json`: contains configuration for Cypress end-to-end tests

- `package.json`: lists dependencies and defines npm scripts

- `README.md`: contains documentation on using Sapper

- `rollup.config.js`: contains configuration for the Rollup module bundler

  - Modify this to use preprocessors like Sass and TypeScript.

There is also a directory named `node_modules` under the `src` directory.
Sapper generates this directory and the files inside it.
Placing files here allows them to be imported using Node resolution rules.
Otherwise imports of the these files would have to use relative paths.
Creating a separate `node_modules` directory from the one at the project root
makes it so these files aren't lost if the top `node_modules` directory
is deleted as part of reinstalling all the dependencies.

Here is the content of the `src/node_modules` directory:

- `@sapper`: contains files provided or generated by Sapper that should not be modified

  - `app.mjs`: exports the Sapper API functions including:

    - `goto` for programmatic navigation
    - `start` which is called by `client.js` described earlier

  - `server.mjs`: exports the Sapper `middleware` function called by `server.js` described earlier

  - `service-worker.js`: exports constants used by `service-worker.js` described earlier

    - `files` is an array of static files to be cached by the ServiceWorker
    - `shell` is an array of files generated by Sapper files to be cached by the ServiceWorker

  - `internal`
    - `App.svelte`: displays the current page or, if there is an error, an error page
    - `error.svelte`: default error page component
      - This displays the status, error message,
        and stack trace (if NODE_ENV is "development").
    - `layout.svelte`: basic page layout containing only a `<slot>`
    - `manifest-client.mjs`: provides data about components and routes for `app.mjs` above
    - `manifest-server.mjs`: provides data about server routes and pages for `server.mjs` above
    - `shared.mjs`: seems to provide nothing

For many applications, most of the files described above
do not require modification.
The most common files to modify are described later.

Add static assets such as images in the `static` directory
and delete the provided images that are not needed.

Modify `static/global.css` to contain CSS that should
be used across all components in the app.

## Dynamic vs. Static Sites

Sapper can be used to build both dynamic web applications
and static web sites.

Dynamic applications can make REST calls
in response to user input.

TODO: Is the next sentence true? You asked on Discord in the Sapper channel on 10/26.:w
TODO: One response was that static sites cannot render client-side error pages,
TODO: perform redirects, or do anything provided by SSR.

Static web sites must make all required REST calls
from component `preload` functions that are invoked
when the site is built by running `npm run export`.
We will learn more about this later
in the "Static Site Generation" section.

To test a dynamic site locally, enter `npm run dev`
and browse localhost:3000.

To prepare a dynamic application for deployment,
enter `npm run build`.
This generates files in the `__sapper__/build`
and `__sapper__/dev` directories.

## Page Routing

Each page in the application is implemented as a Svelte component
defined in the `src/routes` directory.
Route names are derived from the names of
source files and directories found here.

The default Sapper app includes anchor tags
in the file `src/components/Nav.svelte`.
Modify this file to add or remove page navigation anchor tags.

Consider creating a `NavItem` component in `src/components` to simplify this.
For example:

```html
<script>
  import {createEventDispatcher} from 'svelte';
  const dispatch = createEventDispatcher();

  // "default" would be a better name for this, but that's a keyword.
  export let main = false; // optional

  export let href = undefined; // optional
  export let name; // required
  export let rel = undefined; // optional
  export let segment; // required

  const capitalize = text =>
    text
      .split(' ')
      .map(word => word[0].toUpperCase() + word.substring(1).toLowerCase())
      .join(' ');

  const getClass = segment =>
    main ? (segment ? '' : 'selected') : segment === name ? 'selected' : '';

  const handleClick = () => dispatch('click');
</script>

<style>
  a {
    text-decoration: none;
    padding: 1em 0.5em;
    display: block;
  }

  a:hover {
    color: green;
  }

  li {
    display: block;
    float: left;
  }

  .selected {
    position: relative;
    display: inline-block;
  }

  .selected::after {
    position: absolute;
    content: '';
    width: calc(100% - 1em);
    height: 2px;
    background-color: rgb(255, 62, 0);
    display: block;
    bottom: -1px;
  }
</style>

<li>
  <a
    {rel}
    class="{getClass(segment)}"
    href="{href"
    ||
    name}
    on:click="{handleClick}"
  >
    {capitalize(name)}
  </a>
</li>
```

To use this `NavItem` component in the `Nav` component,
modify it to look like this:

```html
<script>
  import NavItem from './NavItem.svelte';
  export let segment;
</script>

<style>
  nav {
    border-bottom: 1px solid rgba(255, 62, 0, 0.1);
    font-weight: 300;
    height: var(--nav-height);
    padding: 0 1em;
  }

  ul {
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
  }
</style>

<nav>
  <ul>
    <NavItem {segment} name="home" />
    <NavItem {segment} name="about" />
    <!-- We will cover "prefetch" later. -->
    <NavItem {segment} name="blog" rel="prefetch" />
  </ul>
</nav>
```

Define additional pages by creating components in the `src/routes` directory.

Add a `NavItem` instance in `src/components/Nav.svelte` for each new page.

The path to the page component source file for a route named `dogs`
is `src/routes/dogs.svelte` or `src/routes/dogs/index.svelte`.
The latter is preferred when there are associated server routes.
These are described in "Server Routes" section later.
Creating the `dogs` directory provides a common location
for these related files.

Files in route directories with names that begin with an underscore
are considered helper files and are not interpreted as routes.

A result of these naming conventions is that there will be
many source files within an app that have names that are
not meaningful on their own (such as `index.svelte`).

Some editors support displaying the directory name of files
along with the file name in the tab of each open file.
In VS Code, this is enabled by setting the
`workbench.editor.labelFormat` option to a value like "short".

## Page Layouts

The main page layout is defined in `src/routes/_layout.svelte`.
Each route can define its own `_layout.svelte` file
that is used to lay out its content
within the main layout.

Conditional logic can be added in this file
to use different layouts depending the current situation.

For example, suppose the app has a login page
that requires a different layout than all the other pages.
Typically the login page does not render links or buttons
to navigate to other pages.

Here is how this might be implemented in `src/routes/_layout.svelte`.
It assumes that we have a store named `authenticated` that
holds a boolean that is set to `true` after a successful login.
If the browser is refreshed, we restore the value
of the `authenticated` store from `sessionStorage`.

```html
<script>
  import {onMount} from 'svelte';
  import {authenticated} from '../stores';
  import Nav from '../components/Nav.svelte';

  // This prop is automatically passed to all layouts.
  // It holds the name of the current route.
  export let segment;

  onMount(() => {
    $authenticated = window.sessionStorage.getItem('authenticated') === 'true';
  });
</script>

<style>
  main {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;

    background-color: linen;
    box-sizing: border-box;
    height: calc(100vh - var(--nav-height));
    padding: 2em;
    width: 100vw;
  }
</style>

{#if $authenticated}
<!-- If the user is authenticated, we want to render a nav bar and
     provide a slot where the current page content will be rendered. -->
<nav {segment} />

<main>
  <section>
    <slot />
  </section>
</main>
{:else}
<!-- If the user is not authenticated, we only want to
     provide a slot where the login page will be rendered. -->
<slot />
{/if}
```

## Server-Side Rendering (SSR)

Sapper provides server-side rendering automatically
with no configuration required.
The client-size app is "hydrated" with server-rendered HTML
rather than recreating the entire DOM for the current page.

HTML for the first page of an app that is accessed
is generated on the server and downloaded to the browser.
Subsequently visited pages are generated on the client
just like in a normal Svelte app.
This allows for a faster app startup experience.

Sapper SSR is similar to the functionality provided by Next.js for React.

There are some restrictions on components that will be server-side rendered.
Such components cannot:

1. access the window object because it is not present
2. rely on lifecycle functions???

There is a way to ensure that a given component will only be rendered client-side.
It utilizes a dynamic import inside an `onMount` function
which is only invoked on the client-side.
TODO: Test this approach!

```html
<script>
  import {onMount} from 'svelte';

  let MyComponent;

  onMount(async () => {
    const module = await import('my-client-only-component.svelte');
    MyComponent = module.default;
  });
</script>

<!-- This renders a component that is discovered at run-time. -->
<svelte:component this={MyComponent} someProp="someValue />
```

## Server Routes

Server routes are Node-based REST services.
They enables implementing web applications where the
client-side and server-side code is colocated in the same project

This is an optional feature.
Sapper apps can invoke REST services that are not implemented in a Sapper app.
And of course the services can be implemented in any programming language,
using any framework.

By default the server routes are managed by Polka (<https://github.com/lukeed/polka>).
Polka is described as "a micro web server so fast, it'll make you dance!"
It was created by Luke Edwards who is also a Sapper contributor.

### Polka

Polka claims to be 33 to 50% faster than Express.
It supports the same middleware as Express.
The Polka API is nearly identical to that of Express.

Sapper applications can easily be modified so that server routes
are managed by another Node.js server library such as Express.

Here are the steps to switch from Polka to Express:

1. `npm uninstall polka`
1. `npm install express`
1. edit `src/server.js`
1. remove `import polka from 'polka';`
1. add `import {express} from 'express`;

To use Express built-in serving of static files instead of `sirv`

1. `npm uninstall sirv`
1. remove `import sirv from 'sirv';`
1. remove `sirv('static', { dev }),`
1. add `express.static('static')),`
1. restart the server

### Server Route Source Files

Sapper has a convention for naming the source files
that define server routes.
Let's assume the route name is "dogs".

Server routes that do not require a path parameter,
such as retrieving all instances of a resource
or creating a new resource
are typically defined in `src/routes/dogs/index.json.js`.

Server routes that do require a path parameter,
such as updating or deleting an existing resource
are typically defined in `src/routes/dogs/[id].json.js`.
The `[id]` part represents a path parameter.

Server routes can only have one path parameter per path part.

### Server Route Functions

Server route functions must do only one of these things:

1. Send a response.
2. Call next, passing it nothing.
   This enables the next "normal" middleware to run.
   One of these can send a response.
3. Call next, passing it an error description.
   This enables the next error handling middleware to run.
   One of these can log the error and/or
   send a response describing the error.

## Fetch API Wrapper

The "module context" is used to define things, such as functions,
that are associated with the module, but not with each instance.

This includes everything defined inside
a `<script context="module">` tag.

The Fetch API, which is built into browsers,
can be used to make REST calls.

When using the Fetch API in module context functions,
use `this.fetch` instead of `fetch`.
This is required in order to ensure availability of the Fetch API
when the function is invoked on the server
as happens during server-side rendering.

For functions defined in a normal `<script>` tag,
use the `fetch` function provided by browsers.

## Just Enough MongoDB

In the example code that follows we will be persisting data using MongoDB.
This choice is strictly based on ease of setup and use.
It is not the best choice for every application.
You should also consider using PostgreSQL and other databases.

MongoDB is a NoSQL database implemented in C++.
It stores documents in collections. Documents are JSON objects.
They are stored in a binary JSON format (BSON).

All documents have an id stored in a property named `_id`.
This is guaranteed to be unique within a collection.

Each collection can have multiple indexes to make queries faster.
Indexes are implemented as B-tree data structures.

There is no need to define a schema that describes
the properties of the document objects.
This speeds up development when the structure changes often
since no schema changes are required.
It also allows properties present in the objects of a collection to vary.
But typically all documents in the same collection have similar properties.

A document property value can be the id of another object,
even in a different collection.
This supports associations between documents.

The free version of MongoDB is called the "Community Edition".

To install the Community Edition on other platforms,
browse <https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/>,
click "Install MongoDB Community Edition" in the left nav.,
click the "Install on" link for your platform (Linux, macOS, or Windows),
and follow the instructions.

To start the MongoDB server, ...
To stop the MongoDB server, ...

MongoDB Shell is a kind of REPL that supports using
JavaScript to interact with a MongoDB database.
To start it, enter `mongo`.
To get help, enter `help`.
To exit, enter `exit` or press ctrl-d.

To see a list of the current databases, enter `show dbs`.

To use a specific database, enter `use {db-name}`.

New databases are created automatically when a document is added to a collection.
For example:

```js
use animals
db.dogs.insert({name: 'Dasher', breed: 'Whippet'})
```

To list all the documents in a collection,
enter `db.{coll-name}.find()`.

To delete a collection, enter `db.{coll-name}.drop()`.

To delete the current database, enter `db.dropDatabase()`.

To add a document to a collection, enter `db.{coll}.insert(obj)`.
For example, `db.dogs.insert({breed: 'Whippet', name: 'Dasher'})`.

- to **get first** 20 documents in a collection,
  `db.{coll}.find()`
  - ex. `db.dogs.find()`
- to **get all objects that match criteria**,
  `db.{coll}.find(criteria)`
  - ex. `db.dogs.find({breed: 'whippet')`
  - ex. `db.tjs.find({lastName: {$gt: 'H'}})`
- to **get number of documents** in a collection,  
  `db.{coll}.find().count() or db.{coll}.find().length()`
- to **find document in collection**,
  `db.{coll}.findOne(query)`
  - a query is just a JavaScript object where
    the keys are document property names and
    the values are document property values
- to **delete a document from collection**,  
  `db.{coll}.deleteOne(query)`
- to **delete documents from collection**,  
  `db.{coll}.deleteMany(query)`
- to **update a document in a collection**,  
  `db.{coll}.updateOne(query, { $set: {key: value, key: value, ...} })`
- to **replace a document in a collection**,  
  `db.{coll}.replaceOne(query, newDocument)`
- to **add an index** to a collection,  
  `db.{coll}.createIndex({{prop-name}: 1});`
  - 1 means ascending order, -1 means descending

## CRUD Example

Let's walk through the steps to implement a page
that supports CRUD operations on dogs.

Here is what we want to create:

![dogs page](./sapper-dogs.png)

With this UI we can:

- See all the dogs that are currently in the database.
- Add a new dog to the database by entering a breed and name,
  and clicking the "Add" button.
- Modify the breed or name of an existing dog in the database
  by clicking the pencil icon next to one,
  modifying the values, and clicking the "Modify" button.
- Delete an existing dog from the database
  by clicking the trash can icon next to one.

Create the directory `src/routes/dogs`.
In this directory, create the following files:

- `index.svelte`  
  This defines the component that renders the UI shown above.

- `index.json.js`  
  This exports middleware functions that get all dogs and create a new dog.

- `[id].json.js`  
  This exports middleware functions that update or delete an existing dog.

- `_helpers.js`  
  This exports a function that returns an object
  for operating on the "dogs" MongoDB collection.

Here is the contents of `src/routes/dogs/index.svelte`:

```html
<script context="module">
  // This is called before this component is rendered
  // to get the dogMap data.
  export async function preload() {
    try {
      // This invokes the "get" middleware function
      // defined in index.json.js.
      const res = await this.fetch('dogs.json');
      if (res.ok) {
        const dogs = await res.json();
        const dogMap = dogs.reduce((acc, dog) => {
          acc[dog._id] = dog;
          return acc;
        }, {});
        // Properties in the object returned are passed to this component as props.
        return {dogMap};
      } else {
        const msg = await res.text();
        this.error(res.statusCode, 'Dogs preload: ' + msg);
      }
    } catch (e) {
      this.error(500, 'Dogs preload error: ' + e.message);
    }
  }
</script>

<script>
  export let dogMap = {};
  export let error = '';

  let breed = '';
  let breedInput;
  let id = '';
  let name = '';

  $: saveBtnText = id ? 'Modify' : 'Add';

  $: sortedDogs = Object.values(dogMap).sort((dog1, dog2) =>
    dog1.name.localeCompare(dog2.name)
  );

  function clearState() {
    id = breed = name = '';
    breedInput.focus();
  }

  async function deleteDog(id) {
    try {
      const options = {method: 'DELETE'};
      // This invokes the "del" middleware function
      // defined in [id].json.js.
      const res = await fetch(`dogs/${id}.json`, options);
      if (!res.ok) throw new Error('failed to delete dog with id ' + id);
      delete dogMap[id];
      dogMap = dogMap;
      clearState();
    } catch (e) {
      error = e.message;
    }
  }

  function editDog(dog) {
    ({breed, name} = dog);
    id = dog._id;
  }

  // This handles both creating and updating dogs.
  async function saveDog() {
    // If `id` is set, we are updating a dog.
    // Otherwise we are creating a new dog.
    const dog = {breed, name};
    if (id) dog._id = id;

    try {
      const options = {
        method: id ? 'PUT' : 'POST',
        headers: {'Content-Type': 'application/json'},
        body: JSON.stringify(dog)
      };
      // Use this.fetch only in module context.
      //const path = 'dogs' + (id ? '/' + id : '') + '.json';
      const path = id ? `dogs/${id}.json` : 'dogs.json';
      // This invokes either
      // the "post" middleware function defined in index.json.js or
      // the "put" middleware function defined in [id].json.js.
      const res = await fetch(path, options);
      let result = await res.json();

      if (!res.ok) throw new Error(result.error);

      dogMap[result._id] = result;
      dogMap = dogMap;
      clearState();
    } catch (e) {
      error = e.message;
    }
  }

  }
}
```

Add a navigation link for the `Dogs` component
by adding the following in `src/components/Nav.svelte`:

```html
<NavItem {segment} name="dogs" rel="prefetch" />
```

Using `rel="prefetch"` causes the `preload` function
in `src/routes/dogs/index.svelte` to be invoked
before the component is rendered.

That's it! We have implement a new route
that supports all the CRUD operations on dogs.

## Pre-fetching

Routes can be configured so the data they required
is downloaded when the user simply hovers over
their anchor tag. This anticipates that the user will
click the anchor tag and results in faster page loads.

This functionality is configured by adding the
`rel="prefetch"` attribute to an anchor tag.

Pre-fetching works in conjunction with code splitting.
The first time a user hovers over an anchor tag
that uses prefetch, JavaScript required by the page is downloaded
and its `preload` function, if any, is called.
The `preload` function can invoke REST services
to gather data needed by the page.

Each route component can export a `preload` function
from its module scope (`<script context="module">`).
This is called before the route component is rendered.

Defining a `preload` function in a component that is not a route
has no purpose because it will never be invoked.

It is not possible to register the same component
for multiple route paths because the route path
also specifies the path to the component `.svelte` file.

Note how `preload` differs from the `onMount` lifecycle function
which is invoked once for each instance of a component
that is created.

If the same route component is used
with more than one route path,
is the `preload` function called once for each?

Here is an example from the Dog component:

```html
<script context="module">
  export async function preload(page, session) {
    try {
      const res = await this.fetch('dogs.json');
      if (res.ok) {
        const dogs = await res.json();
        const dogMap = dogs.reduce((acc, dog) => {
          acc[dog._id] = dog;
          return acc;
        }, {});
        // Properties in the object returned are passed to this component as props.
        return {dogs: dogMap};
      } else {
        const msg = await res.text();
        this.error(res.statusCode, 'Dogs preload: ' + msg);
      }
    } catch (e) {
      this.error(500, 'Dogs preload error: ' + e.message);
    }
  }
</script>
```

If the `rel="prefetch"` attribute is added to the anchor tag (`<a>`)
of a route, its `preload` function will be called
when the user hovers over the anchor tag (or taps on mobile devices).
This happens just once unless the user navigates to another route
or hovers over the anchor tag of another route that uses prefetch.
If either of these actions occur, hovering over the anchor tag
with prefetch will call the `preload` function again.

This cannot be enabled for `<button>` elements,
but anchor tags can be styled to look like buttons.

For example:

```html
<style>
  a {
    border: solid gray 1px;
    border-radius: 4px;
    padding: 4px;
    text-decoration: none;
  }
</style>

<a href="/dogs" rel="prefetch">
  Go To Dogs
</a>
```

The `preload` function is only invoked once before the link is clicked.
Hovering over it multiple times does not trigger multiple invocations.
After navigating to that route and then navigating to another route,
hovering will once again trigger a call to the `preload` function.

## Code Splitting

Code splitting removes the need to download all the JavaScript
for the app when the first page is rendered.
Instead, only the JavaScript needed by the first page is downloaded.
JavaScript for other pages is not downloaded until it is needed.

Svelte produces bundles that are much smaller
than those produced by other frameworks.
But the initial download size can be decreased
even further by code splitting
which is automatically provided by Sapper.
This is a big win for apps that might be run
on slow internet connections or on mobile devices.

When a browser first loads a Sapper app,
only the JavaScript code necessary to
render the first page/route is downloaded.
The code for each remaining route
is not downloaded until it rendered,
typically in response to a user clicking on an anchor tag
which triggers a route change.

For routes whose anchor tag includes `rel="prefetch"`,
download of their JavaScript code begins
when the user hovers over their anchor tag.
For components that export a module-level `preload`
function, that is also called.
These `preload` functions typically invoke REST services to obtain data.

In the starter app, this is specified on
anchor tags in `src/components/Nav.svelte`.

## Static Site Generation

Sapper can crawl the anchor tags in an app
in order to generate HTML for an entire site.
This includes making REST calls to gather data
needed to render pages.

This is similar to the functionality provided by Gatsby for React.

To build a static site, enter `npm run build`,
just like for a dynamic site.
Then enter `npm run export` which generates
files in the `__sapper__/export` directory.

The `export` script recursively crawls every `<a>` tag reachable from
`src/routes/_layout.svelte` to find all the pages of the app.

If any reachable pages contain a
`preload` function that make REST calls,
the servers for those must be running
when the `export` script is run.
Each of these REST calls is invoked and
their results are written to `.json` files.
When the static site is browsed, these `.json` files
are used in place of the REST calls.

To test the site locally, enter `npx serve __sapper__/export`
and browse localhost:5000.

During development of a static site it will be
necessary to run these commands many times.
To simplify this:

1. `npm install -D npm-run-all serve`
2. Add this npm script:

   ```json
   "serve": "serve __sapper__/export",
   ```

3. Add this npm script:

```json
"static": "npm-run-all build export serve",
```

Now `npm run static` can be used to run all three commands.

Let's walk through an example of building a static site
starting with the Sapper app template.
We will modify it so the "About" page is replaced
by a "Dogs" page that displays a list of dogs.

First we will build the app and test it as a dynamic site.

- Enter `npx degit "sveltejs/sapper-template#rollup" my-static-site`.
- Enter `cd my-static-site`.
- Enter `npm install`.
- Enter `npm run dev`.
- Browse localhost:5000.
- Verify that the app works, including clicking the "about" tab.
- Edit `src/components/Nav.svelte` and change all occurrences of "about" to "dogs".
  (Consider describing use of your `NavItem` component.)
- Create a "dogs" directory under `src/routes`.
- Create `src/routes/dogs/index.svelte` containing the following:

  ```html
  <script context="module">
    export async function preload(page, session) {
      try {
        const res = await this.fetch('dogs.json');
        // If the REST service to retrieve all
        // the dogs is hosted outside of Sapper,
        // change the argument to `this.fetch` to be that URL.
        if (res.ok) {
          const dogs = await res.json();
          const dogMap = dogs.reduce((acc, dog) => {
            acc[dog._id] = dog;
            return acc;
          }, {});
          // Properties in the object returned are passed to this component as props.
          return {dogs: dogMap};
        } else {
          const msg = await res.text();
          this.error(res.statusCode, 'Dogs preload: ' + msg);
        }
      } catch (e) {
        this.error(500, 'Dogs preload error: ' + e.message);
      }
    }
  </script>

  <script>
    // The preload function above makes this available as a prop.
    export let dogs;
  </script>

  <svelte:head>
    <title>Dogs</title>
  </svelte:head>

  <h2>Dogs</h2>
  {#each Object.values(dogs) as dog}
  <div>{dog.name} is a {dog.breed}</div>
  {/each}
  ```

The `page` parameter of the `preload` function is an object
with `host`, `path`, `query`, and `params` properties.
An example `host` value is "localhost:3000".
An example `path` value is "dogs".

The `session` parameter of the `preload` function is an object
containing session data, but is undefined when not using sessions.

- Create `src/routes/dogs/index.json.js` containing the following.
  This implements a REST service that is invoked
  by sending a GET request to <http://localhost:3000>.
  If the REST service to retrieve all the dogs
  has been implemented outside of Sapper,
  this file is not needed.

```js
let lastId = 0;
const dogs = {};

function addDog(breed, name) {
  const dog = {id: ++lastId, breed, name};
  dogs[dog.id] = dog;
}

addDog('Whippet', 'Dasher');
addDog('Treeing Walker Coonhound', 'Maisey');
addDog('Native American Indian Dog', 'Ramsey');
addDog('German Shorthaired Pointer', 'Oscar Wilde');

export function get(req, res) {
  res.end(JSON.stringify(dogs));
}
```

- Start the app as a dynamic app by entering `npm run dev`.
- Browse localhost:3000.
- Click the "dogs" tab and verify that a list of dogs is rendered.

Here are the steps to build a static version of this app.
Note that `npm run dev` has already built the app
and created files under the `__sapper__/build`
and `__sapper__/dev` directories,
so it is not necessary to run `npm run build` now.

- If the REST service to retrieve all the dogs
  has been implemented outside of Sapper,
  start that server.
- Enter `npm run export`.
- Enter `npx serve __sapper__/export`.
- Browse localhost:5000.
- Click the "dogs" tab and verify that
  the same list of dogs is rendered,
  this time using a generated `.json` file
  instead of calling a REST service.

### Markdown Pages

Sapper needs a way to generate static content from Markdown files.
TODO: See <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58417881/sapper-svelte-how-do-i-add-markdown-files>
TODO: See <https://github.com/pngwn/MDsveX>

## Image Optimization

Sapper needs a way to automate image optimization.
TODO: See <https://github.com/sveltejs/sapper/issues/172>

## Hot Reloading

Sapper supports live reloading, but does not currently hot reloading.

Live reloading reloads the entire app when a file it uses is modified.
The state of the app is lost.

Hot reloading refreshes modified files in the browser
without losing the application's state.

TODO: Is it true that values in Svelte stores are lost after changes?

## Offline Support Using ServiceWorker

Using a ServiceWorker allows parts of a web application
to continue being usable after network connectivity is lost.

TODO: Is the ServiceWorker enabled by default? I think it is.

TODO: Describe the caching policies it uses by default.

It will use cached REST call data when the data source is unavailable,
such as when a MongoDB server is stopped.

The ServiceWorker can be stopped in the Chrome devtools.
Select the "Application" tab and "Service Workers" in left nav.

## End-to-End Testing

Sapper apps have npm scripts to run Cypress tests (`npm run test`)
and view the results.

However, Cypress is not installed by default.
To install it, enter `npm install -D cypress`.

To run the tests in batch mode so all the results are displayed
in a terminal window, enter `npm run test`.
When running the tests this way,
it is not required to have a local server running.

To run the test in the default browser,
start the server by entering `npm run dev`
and enter `npm run cy:open`.

![Cypress in browser](./cypress.png)

A sample test is provided in `cypress/integration/spec.js`.

To implement a Cypress test ...

## page and session

Where does this content belong?

`page` and `session` are available as stores in all components.
What data do they hold? Try the following:

```html
<script>
  import {stores} from '@sapper/app';
  const {preloading, page, session} = stores();
</script>

{$page} {$session}
```

## Authentication

TODO: Consider describing at least one option for implementing authentication,
TODO: and perhaps authorization, in a Sapper app.
TODO: Perhaps use express-session like in this article:
TODO: <https://www.nielsvandermolen.com/authentication-example-svelte-sapper/>

## Deployment Options

There are many options for deploying web applications.
We will focus on two of them, Netlify and ZEIT Now.
Both provided continuous deployment with zero configuration.
Pushes to the the repository of an application trigger this.

### Deploying With Netlify

Netlify bills itself as "All-in-one platform for automating modern web projects."

TODO: Add screenshots for each of these steps.

To get started using Netlify, browse <https://www.netlify.com/>
and press the "Get started for free" button and sign up.
If you already have an account, click "Log in" in the upper-right.

To add an application, build, and deploy it:

1. Press the "New site from Git" button.
   Code for the application must be in GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.
2. Click the button for one of these repository services.
   A dialog will open.
3. Press the "Authorize ..." button to grant Netlify access.
4. Select the account where Netlify should be installed
   to allow it to host applications in repositories there.
5. Choose between allowing Netlify to access all repositories
   or only selected repositories (preferred).
   If the latter is selected, choose a specific repository.
6. Press the "Install" button.
7. Enter your password for the version control platform.
8. Click a repository name to configure its Netlify options.
   These include the branch to deploy,
   the build command to run, and
   the directory to publish that contains build artifacts.
   In the case of Svelte and Sapper,
   the build command should be `npm run build`.
   The directory to publish for should be "public" for Svelte
   and "**sapper**/build" for Sapper..
9. To set environment variables required by the build process,
   press the "Show advanced" button.
   For each variable, press the "New variable" button
   and enter a name and value.
10. Finally, press the "Deploy site" button.
    The message "Deployment in progress" will appear for a few seconds
    and then the URL of the newly deployed application is displayed.
11. This URL is fine for testing, but you will want a better URL for users.
    To change the URL, press the "Site settings" button
    and the "Change site name" button.
    Enter a new site name that must be unique among
    all domains that end in ".netlify.com".
12. To add a custom domain, press the "Domain settings"
    and "Add custom domain" buttons.
13. To run the app, click its URL link or enter the URL in a browser.

To trigger a new deploy, click "Deploys" near the top of the page,
click the "Trigger deploy" drop-down,
and select "Deploy site".

Netlify sites are automatically secured with HTTPS
using a "Let's Encrypt" certificate.

When changes are pushed to the repository,
Netlify will automatically build and deploy it.

Netlify has three tiers, Starter, Pro, and Business.
The Starter tier is free and only supports a single user.
The Pro tier is $45/month and adds support for 3+ team members
and password-protected sites.
The Business tier is $500+/month and adds
single sign-on (SSO), role-based access control (RBAC),
full audit logs, 24/7/365 support options, a CDN,
and a 99.99% uptime SLA.
Pricing is also based on bandwidth usage and amount of monthly build times.

TODO: Summarize pricing for advanced features.

TODO: How does this handle apps that require a database such as MongoDB?

TODO: Consider describing the steps to deploy a Sapper app on Netlify.

TODO: What are Netlify Immutable Deploys? See <https://www.swyx.io/writing/svelte-static/>.

### Deploying With ZEIT Now

ZEIT Now bills itself as "The easiest way to deploy websites."

TODO: Add screenshots for each of these steps.

To get started using ZEIT Now, browse <https://zeit.co/>.
and press the "Deploy Free" button.
Then create an account by clicking the "Continue with GitHub" button,
"Continue with GitLab" button, or "continue with email" link.
Follow the instructions to finish creating an account.

If you already have an account, click "Login" in the upper-right.

Code for each project must be in a GitHub repository,
a GitLab repository, or be created from a predefined template.
There are templates for many kinds of projects including
"Create-React-App", "Next.js", "Gatsby",
"Vue.js", "Nuxt.js", "Svelte", and "Sapper".
Note that Bitbucket is not currently supported.

To add a project, build, and deploy it:

1. Click "Create New Project".
2. The first time a given repository service is used,
   Now integration must be installed.
   For example, for GitHub click the "Install Now For GitHub" button.
3. Select an account, and enable it for
   "All repositories" or "Only select repositories".
4. Press the "Install" button.
5. Enter the password for the repository service.
6. To use an existing repository,
   select it and press the "IMPORT" button.
7. Wait for the initial project build to complete.
8. To run the app, browse the provided URL
   which will have the format {project-name}.{username}.now.sh".
   Alternatively, just press the "VISIT" button.

When changes are pushed to the repository,
ZEIT Now will automatically build and deploy it.

TODO: Can you specify the branch to watch or is it only "master"?

ZEIT Now has four tiers, Free, Pro, Business, and Enterprise.
The Free tier only supports a single user.
The Pro tier is $20/month and adds support for 3+ team members.
The Business tier is $200/month and adds
"email domain single sign-on", an SLA for 100% uptime,
and custom SSL certificates.
The Enterprise tier has custom pricing and adds
24/7/365 chat support, role-based access control, and full audit logs.
Pricing is also based on bandwidth usage and amount of monthly build times.

TODO: Does your code have to be public in order to use the free tier?
TODO: Summarize pricing for advanced features.

## Conclusion

There you have it! Sapper is a great addition to Svelte.
Most Svelte applications should be built with Sapper.
