    <h2>English ... and how I'd change it</h2>

    <p>
      This page presents my thoughts on issues with the English language.
    </p>

    <h3>Weird Punctuation</h3>
    <p>
      Instead of writing
      <span style="border:solid black 1px">
        The title of the book is "Bad Rules."
      </span>
      &nbsp;write
      <span style="border:solid black 1px">
        The title of the book is "Bad Rules".
      </span>
      &nbsp;Note the location of the period.
      The rules of English say the period belongs inside the quotes.  Why?
      The title of the book doesn't contain a period in it
      and what is inside the quotes should to be the title of the book.
      Rebel!  Don't follow this English rule!
    </p>

    <h3>Wasteful Words</h3>
    <p>
      Write what you mean in as few words as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of writing
      <span style="border:solid black 1px">
        Tell me whether <b>or not</b> you like cheese.
      </span>,
      just write
      <span style="border:solid black 1px">
        Tell me whether you like cheese.
      </span>
      &nbsp;We all know there's a possibility you don't like cheese.
      That's why we're asking.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of writing
      <span style="border:solid black 1px">
        The walls are two <b>different</b> colors.
      </span>
      &nbsp;write
      <span style="border:solid black 1px">
        The walls are two colors.
      </span>
      &nbsp;Nobody will think it's possible you meant
      the walls are two colors that are blue and blue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of writing
      <span style="border:solid black 1px">
        The colors of apples, bananas, and grapes are
        typically red, yellow, and green<b>, respectively</b>.
      </span>
      &nbsp;leave off
      <span style="border:solid black 1px">
        , respectively
      </span>
      &nbsp;Who in their right mind would change the order?
    </p>

    <h3>Gender</h3>
    <p>
      Using gender specific pronouns like "he" and "she" ruffle feathers
      when there is no reason to specify a particular gender.
      Many people try be politically correct by alternativing between them.
      English rules say you shouldn't use a generic word like "them" or "they".
      I say do it anyway.  Instead of writing
      <span style="border:solid black 1px">
        When an employee is feeling angry,
        tell <b>her</b> to take a walk around the building.
      </span>,
      write
      <span style="border:solid black 1px">
        When an employee is feeling angry,
        tell <b>them</b> to take a walk around the building.
      </span>
    </p>
